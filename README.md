# PADLoC: LiDAR-Based Deep Loop Closure Detection and Registration Using Panoptic Attention
## Loop CLosure Detection:
It is basically **_improving the mistakes done before_**

Imagine a robot is exploring a mall, trying to make a map of the different stores and hallways. As it moves around, it takes pictures and notes where it sees things like doors, windows, and displays.
However, as the robot keeps moving, small mistakes in its steps and senses can add up, causing its map to get a bit messed up compared to the real layout of the mall.
Loop closure detection helps fix this problem by letting the robot recognize when it has returned to a place it has already been before.
